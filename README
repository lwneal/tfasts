Time-Frequency Audio Segmentation Tool Set
Oregon State University Bioacoustics Group

TFASTS is a set of command-line tools for manipulating audio in the spectrogram domain.

You can use TFASTS to remove some noise from audio recordings, given examples of the type of sound you want to hear.

Basic usage:

        learn clearly_recorded_audio_files/african_swallows/ african_swallow.rf

Scans your collection of audio recordings of African Swallow mating calls, and constructs a statistical model of their sound.

        filter -m african_swallow.rf new_noisy_input.wav filtered_output.wav

Given a new, noisy input audio file, uses the statistical model to remove everything that doesn't sound like an African Swallow.

The quality of results depends on how many recordings of swallows you have, how much non-Swallow noise exists in the source recordings, and the parameters you use while constructing the model.
